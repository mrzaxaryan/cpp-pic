 * @brief DJB2 Hash Algorithm Implementation
 *
 * @details Implements the DJB2 hash algorithm, originally created by
 * Daniel J. Bernstein and first published in comp.lang.c (1991). The algorithm
 * computes a non-cryptographic hash using the recurrence hash(i) = hash(i-1) * 33 + c,
 * where 33 is chosen for its favorable distribution properties. DJB2 is the hash
 * function used in Bernstein's CDB (constant database) package.
 *
 * This implementation extends the original algorithm with:
 * - **Build-unique seeding:** The initial hash value is derived from __DATE__ using
 *   FNV-1a, producing different hash outputs per compilation. This defeats static
 *   signature matching against known hash constants.
 * - **Case-insensitive hashing:** Characters are lowercased before hashing, enabling
 *   Windows API name resolution where export names are case-insensitive.
 * - **Dual evaluation modes:** Both runtime (`Hash`) and compile-time (`HashCompileTime`)
 *   variants are provided, allowing compile-time hash precomputation for constant
 *   expressions used in API resolution comparisons.
 * - **Wide string support:** Templated on character type to support both CHAR and WCHAR
 *   inputs with a single implementation.

/**
 * @brief Compile-time FNV-1a hash for DJB2 seed generation
 *
 * @details Computes a hash of the given string using the Fowler-Noll-Vo 1a (FNV-1a)
 * algorithm with 32-bit parameters extended to 64-bit arithmetic:
 * 1. Initialize hash to the FNV-1 32-bit offset basis (2166136261 / 0x811C9DC5)
 * 2. For each byte of input: XOR the byte into the hash, then multiply by the
 *    FNV-1 32-bit prime (16777619 / 0x01000193)
 * 3. Arithmetic is performed in 64-bit to allow natural overflow accumulation
 *
 * This function is invoked with __DATE__ to produce a build-unique seed for
 * the DJB2 hash, ensuring that hash values differ across compilations. The
 * consteval qualifier guarantees the computation is fully resolved at compile
 * time and never appears in the generated binary as a runtime call.
 *
 * @param s Null-terminated string to hash (typically __DATE__)
 * @return FNV-1a hash value computed entirely at compile time
 *
 * @see IETF Draft Section 6.2 — FNV-1a algorithm description
 *      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-eastlake-fnv#section-6.2
 * @see IETF Draft Section 7.1 — FNV-1 32-bit parameters (offset basis and prime)

/**
 * @class Djb2
 * @brief DJB2 hash algorithm implementation for case-insensitive string hashing
 *
 * @details Provides both runtime and compile-time string hashing using the DJB2
 * algorithm by Daniel J. Bernstein. The core recurrence is:
 * @code
 * hash = hash * 33 + c
 * @endcode
 * which is computed as `(hash << 5) + hash + c` to avoid multiplication.
 * The multiplier 33 was chosen by Bernstein for its empirically favorable
 * distribution properties across typical string inputs.
 *
 * All hashing is case-insensitive: each character is converted to lowercase
 * via String::ToLowerCase() before being folded into the hash. This is
 * essential for Windows PE export name resolution, where DLL export names
 * may differ in casing across Windows versions.
 *
 * The initial hash value (seed) is not the traditional DJB2 constant 5381,
 * but is instead derived at compile time from __DATE__ via FNV-1a hashing.
 * This makes every build produce a unique set of hash values, preventing
 * signature-based detection of known API hash constants.
 *
 * @par Typical usage — API name resolution:
 * @code
 * // Precompute hash at compile time
 * constexpr UINT64 TARGET = Djb2::HashCompileTime("LoadLibraryA");
 *
 * // Walk PE export table, compute hash at runtime, compare
 * if (Djb2::Hash(exportName) == TARGET)
 * {
 *     // Resolved LoadLibraryA
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see DJB2 Hash Function — Daniel J. Bernstein, comp.lang.c (1991)
