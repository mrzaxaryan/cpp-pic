/**
 * @file dns.h
 * @brief DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) resolver — resolves hostnames to IP addresses via encrypted DNS
 *
 * @details Implements a minimal DNS stub resolver that sends standard DNS wire-format queries
 * (RFC 1035) over HTTPS (RFC 8484) to public recursive resolvers (Cloudflare 1.1.1.1,
 * Google 8.8.8.8). The resolver supports both A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) record types
 * and automatically falls back from IPv6 to IPv4 when AAAA resolution fails.
 *
 * Transport uses TLS 1.3 with HTTP/1.1 POST to the /dns-query endpoint, sending the
 * raw DNS message in the request body with Content-Type: application/dns-message
 * (RFC 8484 Section 4.1). This avoids plaintext DNS and works in environments where
 * UDP port 53 is blocked.
 *
 * Protocol flow:
 *   1. Build a standard DNS query (RFC 1035 Section 4.1)
 *   2. Open a TLS 1.3 connection to the DoH server
 *   3. POST the query as application/dns-message (RFC 8484 Section 4.1)
 *   4. Read the HTTP response and parse the DNS wire-format answer
 *   5. Extract the A or AAAA record from the answer section
 *
 * @see RFC 1035 — Domain Names: Implementation and Specification
 *      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035
 * @see RFC 3596 — DNS Extensions to Support IP Version 6 (AAAA record)
