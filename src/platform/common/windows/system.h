 * @brief Windows System Call Interface and Indirect Syscall Dispatch
 *
 * @details Provides the low-level system call mechanism for Windows NT. On
 * x86_64 and i386, system calls are executed via indirect syscall gadgets
 * found within ntdll.dll, avoiding direct calls into ntdll and bypassing
 * userland hooks. On ARM64, where the kernel validates that the SVC
 * instruction originates from within ntdll, calls are dispatched directly
 * through the resolved ntdll stub address.
 *
 * The System Service Number (SSN) and a syscall gadget address are resolved
 * at runtime by scanning the ntdll export table for the target Zw* function,
 * then extracting the SSN from the function's prologue bytes and locating a
 * nearby syscall/sysenter instruction to use as the indirect call target.
 *
 * The System::Call overloads accept 0-14 arguments and set up the correct
 * calling convention for each architecture:
 * - x86_64: rcx->r10 swap, args in r10/rdx/r8/r9 + stack shadow space
 * - i386: all args pushed onto the stack, EAX holds SSN
 * - ARM64: args in x0-x7 + stack, BLR to ntdll stub address in x16
 *

 *      https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-nt-and-zw-versions-of-the-native-system-services-routines

 * @brief Provides indirect system call dispatch for Windows NT Native API functions.

 *
 * Usage pattern:
 * 1. Resolve: `auto entry = ResolveSyscall("ZwFunctionName");`
 * 2. Validate: Check `entry.Ssn != SYSCALL_SSN_INVALID`
 * 3. Dispatch: `NTSTATUS status = System::Call(entry, arg1, arg2, ...);`
