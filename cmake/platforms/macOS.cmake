#   aarch64: adrp+ldr via GOT page          →  adrp+add direct
# The linker materializes these into a __DATA_CONST,__got section — a synthetic
# section that CANNOT be merged into __TEXT,__text via -rename_section. Since
# the PIC loader only maps __TEXT,__text, any GOT reference hits unmapped memory
# and crashes (SIGSEGV). This flag forces direct PC-relative access for all
# data symbols on both architectures.

# linker treats weak symbols (e.g. template explicit instantiations like
# SHABase<SHA256Traits>) as interposable and generates __TEXT,__stubs +
# __DATA,__la_symbol_ptr sections. The stubs load pointers from __DATA, which
# is not mapped by the PIC loader, causing a crash on any call through a stub.
# Hidden visibility tells both the compiler and linker that symbols cannot be
# interposed, eliminating stubs. This is especially critical on aarch64 where
# -static is not used (ARM64 macOS requires dyld).

# At -Os/-Oz with -flto=full, the LTO backend emits constant-pool data
# (from __const/__literal4/__literal8/... sections renamed into __TEXT,__text)
# and unnamed helper sequences BEFORE _entry_point in the merged section.
# These unnamed regions do not appear in the linker map's "# Symbols:" table,
# so VerifyPICMode cannot catch them, yet they land at offset 0 of output.bin.
# The PIC loader always jumps to offset 0, hitting unnamed data and crashing.
#
# ld64.lld places non-LTO input sections BEFORE all LTO-generated sections in
# the final output.  Compiling entry_point.cc without LTO produces a regular
# object whose __TEXT,__text (containing only _entry_point) is inserted FIRST,
# before any LTO-generated constant pools or code, guaranteeing _entry_point
# lands at offset 0 of the extracted PIC binary at every optimization level.
#
# The -fno-lto flag is appended after -flto=full in the per-file compile
# command, so it overrides the LTO mode for this single translation unit.
# entry_point() calls start() (in the LTO object) via a PC-relative CALL/BL,

    # (e.g. 0x100000b7c — after the Mach-O headers), so the page deltas bake in
    # a 0xb7c page offset. When the PIC loader extracts __text into output.bin
    # and loads it via mmap at a page-aligned address (offset 0x0), the page
    # boundaries within the code shift, and every ADRP instruction computes the
    # wrong page — producing corrupted function pointers (SIGSEGV / SIGILL).
